{"name":"Netscaler Cookie Decryptor","tagline":"Python application to decrypt Netscaler Load Balancer Persistence Cookies","body":"Netscaler Cookie Decryptor\r\nby @catalyst256\r\n\r\nThis python script will take a Citrix Netscaler persistence cookie and decrypt the values. This will allow you to determine the internal addresses of a Netscaler load balanced website. Typically Netscaler cookies start with NSC_\r\n\r\nTHis is an example of a Netscaler Cookie from the internet:\r\n\r\nNSC_Qspe-xxx.bwjwb.dp.vl-IUUQ=ffffffff50effd8445525d5f4f58455e445a4a423660\r\n\r\nYou can then run this through the Netscaler Cookie Decryptor using from the command line:\r\n\r\nnsccookiedecrypt.py NSC_Qspe-xxx.bwjwb.dp.vl-IUUQ=ffffffff50effd8445525d5f4f58455e445a4a423660\r\n\r\nThis would return you the following:\r\n\r\nServer Name=Prod-www.xxxxx.co.uk-HTTP\r\nServer IP=83.231.227.149\r\nServer Port=80\r\n\r\nThis code will work on Windows (tested) and Linux (tested) and probably OSX (not tested).\r\n\r\nThanks to:\r\nAlejandro Nolla Blanco - alejandro.nolla@gmail.com - @z0mbiehunt3r - for the inspiration to write this and for adding the error correction.\r\nDaniel Grootveld - danielg75@gmail.com - @shDaniell - for helping with the XOR method of decryption, adding the service port decryption and for making my regex more robust.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-40735183-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
